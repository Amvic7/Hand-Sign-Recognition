# Hand Sign Recognition Project

This project uses MediaPipe and TensorFlow to recognize hand signs and translate them into text. It detects hand gestures using the webcam and predicts the sign language letter using a trained model.

## Features:
- Real-time hand sign recognition.
- Builds sentences by detecting consecutive hand signs.
- Space added when no hand is detected.
- Press 'e' to erase the sentence.
